# humble limadou tracking system 

repository dedicated to my work done for my bachelor degree in physics working with INFN and UNITO at the Limadou project.
i was asked to improve the tracking system for the satellite to make computing and time usage more efficient and versatile for a wider data per event.
this code written in c++ and ROOT firstly create a MonteCarlo simulation based on the test done with hardware here on the earth with muons and protons and then 
helped with the mc sim i changed some of the original functions of the official repository achieve my goals.

to run the code you firstly need to build it: go in the /build directory

$ cmake ..

$ make 

$ ./sim_MC

if the code is set properly and all the libraries are install the code should works (always make a pray first)
